# Check Claude.md Size

Measure and report agent instruction file sizes (`CLAUDE.md`; `AGENTS.md` on Codex; `GEMINI.md` on Gemini CLI). Warn when files exceed optimal token budget. Suggest optimization when needed.

## Size Thresholds

| Size | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| < 300 words | Optimal | No action needed |
| 300-600 words | Acceptable | Monitor growth |
| 600-1,000 words | Bloated | Run optimize-claudemd |
| > 1,000 words | Critical | Immediate optimization needed |

## Check Procedure

### Scan All claude.md Files

```bash
# Global
wc -w ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null
wc -w ~/.claude/claude.md 2>/dev/null

# Project (whichever the harness reads)
wc -w ./CLAUDE.md ./claude.md ./AGENTS.md ./GEMINI.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Report Format

```
CLAUDE.MD SIZE CHECK
====================
Global (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md):   [N] words ≈ [N*1.3] tokens  [STATUS]
Project (./CLAUDE.md):          [N] words ≈ [N*1.3] tokens  [STATUS]

Combined constant cost: ~[N] tokens per response

[WARNING if any file is Bloated/Critical]
Run: /context-forge:optimize-claudemd to reduce size
```

## Automatic Session-Start Check

The SessionStart hook (`hooks/scripts/session-start.sh`) performs this same
check automatically — it does not invoke this skill. Use the skill for
on-demand checks mid-session; don't re-run it right after session start,
the hook already reported. On session start the hook:

1. Check all claude.md file sizes
2. If any file > 600 words: print warning
3. If any file > 1,000 words: print critical warning with optimization command

Warning format:
```
⚠ TOKEN SAVER: claude.md is [N] words ([STATUS])
  Run /context-forge:optimize-claudemd to reduce by ~[%]%
```

## What Makes claude.md Grow

Common causes of bloat:
- Accumulated instructions over time without pruning
- Paste of full API docs or schemas
- Duplicate rules from different sessions
- Long prose explanations instead of bullet rules
- Examples that should be in `references/` files

## LTX Schema

Emit structured output as LTX rows when reporting file sizes.

```
@v1:file|words|tokens|level
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `file` | Path to the claude.md file checked |
| `words` | Raw word count |
| `tokens` | Estimated tokens (`words * 1.3`, rounded) |
| `level` | `ok`, `warn` (600–999 words), `critical` (≥1000 words) |

Example:
```
@v1:file|words|tokens|level
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md|850|1105|critical
./CLAUDE.md|320|416|ok
```
