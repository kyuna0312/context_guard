# Settings Diff

Show a before/after diff of settings.json changes before applying. Always run this before writing settings changes.

## Diff Procedure

### Step 1: Read Current Settings

Read all relevant settings files:
- `~/.claude/settings.json`
- `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
- `./.claude/settings.json`
- `./.claude/settings.local.json`

### Step 2: Compute Proposed Changes

Based on optimization goals, compute the minimal diff needed. Never change
settings not related to the stated goal, and **never propose a key that
isn't in the official settings reference** — an unknown key is silently
ignored, so the diff would promise savings it can't deliver.

### Step 3: Present Diff

Format diff clearly:

```
SETTINGS DIFF
═════════════
File: ~/.claude/settings.json

BEFORE                           AFTER
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"autoMemoryEnabled": true    →   "autoMemoryEnabled": false
[not present]                →   "disableBundledSkills": true

Impact:
  Token reduction: ~[N] tokens per response (~[%]%)
  Behavior change: Auto memory off; bundled skills skipped at startup.
  Reversible: Yes (edit settings.json to revert)
```

### Step 4: Confirm Before Writing

Always ask:
```
Apply these changes to [file]? (yes/no)
```

Never write without explicit confirmation.

## Diff Format for Multiple Files

When changes span multiple files:

```
SETTINGS DIFF — 2 files
═══════════════════════

[1/2] ~/.claude/settings.json
──────────────────────────────
  "autoMemoryEnabled": true → false
  + "disableBundledSkills": true

[2/2] ./.claude/settings.local.json  
──────────────────────────────────────
  + "disabledMcpjsonServers": ["unused-server"]

Apply both changes? (yes/no/select)
```

## Revert Instructions

After any settings change, show revert command:

```
To revert: edit [file] and restore original values.
Backup saved to: [file].backup.[timestamp]
```

Always create a `.backup` copy before writing changes.
